  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Well, as I first introduced myself, I am Semane. I am 33 years old. <br>
    but still eager and interested to learn.I mentioned my academic documents.<br>
    Now on to non-academic qualifications, I generally
    like to dabble in any art. First, I started by learning Photoshop.<br>
    Then it was over, I said what should I do now, I went to learn photography,
    it's over, what's left, I went to work as an artist,<br> I saw something else,
    no, this will end soon, and finally I found that main goal and interest,
    which is programming, and now I've reached it and I will continue.<br> sorry,
    my English is not very good. And I succeed
